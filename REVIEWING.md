# Reviewing Guide

This document describes who may review pull requests for Project Copacetic, and provides guidance on how to conduct reviews that meet our community standards and code of conduct. All reviewers must read and agree to follow these guidelines. Failure to follow the review guidelines may result in removal of reviewing privileges.

## The Reviewer Role

The reviewer role is distinct from the maintainer role. Reviewers can approve pull requests, but only maintainers can merge them. Maintainers handle final approval and merging. Reviewers provide feedback, ensure code quality, and uphold community standards.

## Values

All reviewers must abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and are protected by it. Reviewers should not tolerate poor behavior and are encouraged to report violations.

### Inclusion

- Be welcoming and inclusive. Proactively help authors succeed, even if their PR isn’t ultimately merged.
- Answer unasked questions and offer concrete help if contributors appear stuck.

### Sustainability

- Encourage contributors to meet baseline requirements (e.g., tests).
- If you’re unavailable, step down from a PR and have someone else assigned.
- If interactions violate the Code of Conduct, close the PR and elevate the issue to the Code of Conduct committee or point of contact.

### Trust

- **Transparency:** If a PR won’t be merged, clearly state why and close it. If review will be delayed, inform the author.
- **Integrity:** Put the project’s best interests ahead of personal or company interests.
- **Stability:** Only approve and merge changes that maintain or improve project stability, even under time pressure or feature demand.

## Review Process

1. **Assignment:** Pull requests may be assigned to reviewers by maintainers or requested by contributors.
2. **Review:** Reviewers assess the PR for code quality, adherence to guidelines, test coverage, documentation, and impact on stability.
3. **Feedback:** Provide clear, actionable, and kind feedback. Engage in discussion if clarification is needed.
4. **Approval:** If the PR meets the project’s standards, a reviewer may approve it.
5. **Final Approval:** Only maintainers may merge PRs, after ensuring all requirements and approvals are met.
6. **Escalation:** If there are conflicts or Code of Conduct concerns, escalate to maintainers or the Code of Conduct contact.
