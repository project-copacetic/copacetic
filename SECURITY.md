# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Copacetic remains in the process of getting to a stable v1.0 release, and as such does not currently provide a long-term supported version.
We make a good faith effort to respond to security issues in a timely manner and will release version updates as needed to address them.
Users should expect to upgrade to the latest release version to stay current on security updates.

## Communication

We will publish known vulnerabilities through a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic/security/advisories) once they have been addressed to inform the community of their potential scope, impact, and mitigation.

## Reporting Security Issues

Project Copacetic and its maintainers takes the security of the project seriously, and we appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings to us.

> **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them through our [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic/security/advisories/new) form.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

We believe in [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure) and will work with you through the private advisory report.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
