# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Copacetic is in the process of reaching a stable v1.0 release and currently does not offer long-term supported versions.

We make a good-faith effort to:
- Respond to reported security issues promptly
- Release patch updates as needed

Users should upgrade to the latest release version to stay up to date with security patches.
